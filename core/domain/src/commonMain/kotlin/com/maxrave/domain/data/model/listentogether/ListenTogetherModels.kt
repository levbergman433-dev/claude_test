/**
 * Listen Together, as the rest of the app sees it.
 *
 * These mirror the protocol types in `core/service/listenTogether` on purpose. The service module
 * is the wire format — its shapes are dictated by Metrolist's `.proto` and may not be changed —
 * while these belong to this app and can. Repeating them is what keeps the UI from importing the
 * service directly and pinning our screens to someone else's schema.
